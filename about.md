This page contains articles, observations and code related to research i am doing either in a personal or professional capacity. I currently work as a research assistant with the [Services, Cyber security and Safety research group at the University of Twente](https://scs.ewi.utwente.nl/) where i mainly focus on embedded systems security in general and exploit development and mitigation in particular as well as malware analysis and intrusion detection. I do occasional consulting for [LeakFree IT Security](http://www.leakfree.nl/).
