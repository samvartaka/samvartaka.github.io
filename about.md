This page contains articles, observations and code related to research i am doing either in a personal or professional capacity. I currently work as a research assistant with the [Services, Cyber security and Safety research group at the University of Twente](https://scs.ewi.utwente.nl/) where i mainly focus on malware analysis, exploitation techniques and intrusion detection. My github can be found [here](https://github.com/samvartaka) and e-mails can be directed here (PGP public key available upon request):
